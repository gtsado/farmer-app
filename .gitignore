# SQLite database file
# It is generally good practice to IGNORE your local SQLite database file
# because:
# 1. Data created during development/testing isn't typically part of the source code.
# 2. It can grow large and bloat your Git repository history.
# 3. For ephemeral environments like Streamlit Cloud's free tier, the database
#    will be recreated from scratch (or revert to a committed version if not ignored)
#    on every app restart anyway.
